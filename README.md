# Deep_Vision_Project

This is the github repository for my final project in the course "Deep Vision" in the summer semester 2020.
For my project I created CIFAR-10 like pictures using conditional GANs.

My models are defined in CGAN_Discriminator.py, CGAN_Generator.py and CGAN_model.py respectively MSG_CGAN_Discriminator.py, MSG_CGAN_Generator.py and MSG_CGAN_model.py.

The Jupyther notebook Use.ipynb is where I trained my models and created graphics.
The weights of the trained networks can be found in the file "weights"
